# Learn SciPy

To run, use Visual Studio Code or any other application which supports Jupyter notebooks. Run the following
commands to install the necessary packages. It's recommended that you install the packages in a virtual enviornment instead of globally.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
